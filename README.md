# Udacity Deep Learning Project 1

## First neural network

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

## How to Run 

### Installing Anaconda
Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You can find the installers and installation instructions at https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

### Running notebook
From the project directory: 
`conda create --name dlnd python=3`
`source activate dlnd`
`conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`
`jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb`
